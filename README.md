# LabVIEW-SyringePump-ViciActuator-Dynamic-Control
A dynamic phases/Array control of TSE Syringe Pump and Vici Multiposition Microelectric Valve Actuator (Models EMH and EMT with Controllers EMHCA-CE or EMTCA-CE) using LabVIEW RS232 Communications
 
Functions & Features:

• Add Array having data of valve position, Solution Name, Pump rate and Target Volume or Target Time (you want to run the pump for)

• Feature to choose the pump control based on target time (seconds) or Volume (ml)

• Feature to save and load the experiment arrays/phases (valve position, Solution Name, Pump rate and Target Volume or Target Time)

• Delete the Last array

• Option to select/unselect the arrays

• Delete the unselected arrays

• LEDs showing the completion of array phase

• LED showing the Program is busy

• Option to choose syringe diameter, pump units (μl/hr, μl/min, ml/hr, ml/min)

• Automatically calculates the maximum and minimum flow rate available for choosen syringe diameter and pump units

• The parameters (Pump Direction, Volume dispensed, pump direction) display during the run

• Feature to save simulation data including the time duration, solution name and volume dispensed

• Option to clear the simulation data
